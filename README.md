<h3>Building a notification system for schools that delivers updates and 
reminders to students and parents</h3>
<p>The "Notification Management System for School" is a project developed for the Connect Novu Hackathon. It offers an efficient solution for schools to manage notifications. The system includes an admin module for managing teachers, classes, and student data. Teachers can send posts to their assigned classes, while students and parents can access these posts through their respective modules. In-app and email notifications ensure timely updates. This system streamlines communication and improves engagement within the school community.</p>
